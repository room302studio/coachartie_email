## Environment Variables

### VPS Server (.env)

- `RESEND_API_KEY` - Resend API key for sending emails
- `FROM_EMAIL` - Your verified sender email (e.g., coach@coachartiebot.com)
- `SUPABASE_URL` - Supabase project URL
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Supabase anonymous key
- `CAPABILITIES_URL` - Coach Artie capabilities API URL
- `WEBHOOK_SECRET` - Secret for authenticating webhook requests
- `CLOUDFLARE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` - Secret from Cloudflare worker

### Cloudflare Worker (via wrangler secret)

- `WEBHOOK_URL` - Your VPS webhook endpoint
- `WEBHOOK_SECRET` - Shared secret for authentication
- `APPROVED_RECIPIENTS` - Comma-separated list of allowed emails (optional)

## Database Schema

Add this table to your Supabase database:

```sql
CREATE TABLE email_threads (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  user_email TEXT NOT NULL,
  subject TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  last_message_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  message_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0
);

CREATE INDEX idx_email_threads_user_email ON email_threads(user_email);
CREATE INDEX idx_email_threads_last_message ON email_threads(last_message_at);
```

## API Endpoints

- `POST /webhook/email` - Receives emails from Cloudflare worker
- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint

## Email Thread Management

- **New Conversation**: Creates new thread for each email address
- **Ongoing Conversation**: Continues thread if email received within 24 hours
- **Context Preservation**: All messages stored with thread ID for memory
- **Cross-Platform Linking**: Future support for linking email to Discord identity

## Deployment

### VPS Deployment

```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Start with PM2 (recommended)
pm2 start dist/index.js --name coachartie-email

# Or use systemd service
sudo systemctl start coachartie-email
```

### Cloudflare Worker Deployment

```bash
cd cloudflare
wrangler deploy --env production
```

## Testing

```bash
# Unit tests
npm test

# Test email parsing
npm run email:test

# Manual webhook test
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/webhook/email \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "cf-webhook-auth: your-secret" \
  -d '{"from":"test@example.com","to":"coach@yourdomain.com","subject":"Test","body":{"text":"Hello Coach Artie!"}}'
```

## Security

- All webhook requests authenticated with bearer token
- Cloudflare worker validates webhook secret
- Optional recipient filtering in worker
- Email content sanitized before processing

## Cross-Platform Identity Linking (Future)

Enable users to link their email to Discord identity:

```
Discord: /link email user@example.com
â†’ Verification email sent
â†’ User confirms link
â†’ Email conversations now have full Discord memory/context
```

## Monitoring

- Structured logging with Winston
- Optional Loki integration for log aggregation
- Health check endpoint for uptime monitoring
- Error notifications via email

## ðŸ”§ When Shit Breaks (Troubleshooting)

### "I sent an email but got no response"

**Check 1**: Is your server running?
```bash
curl http://your-server.com/health
# Should return: {"status":"ok",...}
```

**Check 2**: Are emails reaching Cloudflare?
```bash
wrangler tail  # Watch live logs
# Send test email and see if logs show up
```

**Check 3**: Is the webhook working?
```bash
npm run email:test
# Should see "âœ… Test email webhook successful!"
```

### "Authentication errors" 

Your `WEBHOOK_SECRET` needs to match in 3 places:
- Your server `.env` file
- Cloudflare worker secrets (`wrangler secret put WEBHOOK_SECRET`)
- They should be EXACTLY the same string

### "Resend API errors"

1. **Domain not verified**: Go to Resend dashboard â†’ Domains â†’ Verify your domain
2. **Wrong API key**: Create new key in Resend dashboard â†’ API Keys
3. **Wrong FROM_EMAIL**: Must match your verified domain (e.g., `coach@yourdomain.com`)

### "Database errors"

**Check 1**: Did you create the table?
```sql
-- Run this in Supabase SQL editor:
CREATE TABLE email_threads (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  user_email TEXT NOT NULL,
  subject TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  last_message_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  message_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0
);
```

**Check 2**: Are your Supabase credentials correct?
- `SUPABASE_URL` should start with `https://`
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` should be the "anon public" key, not service role

### "Worker deployment failed"

```bash
# Make sure you're logged in
wrangler auth login

# Check your wrangler.toml has the right webhook URL
cd cloudflare
cat wrangler.toml

# Deploy again
wrangler deploy
```

### "Still broken?"

**Check logs**:
```bash
# Server logs
tail -f logs/combined.log

# Worker logs  
wrangler tail

# Health check
curl http://your-server.com/health
```

**Test in isolation**:
```bash
# Test just the webhook
npm run email:test

# Test just Resend API
curl -X POST https://api.resend.com/emails \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"from":"coach@yourdomain.com","to":"test@gmail.com","subject":"test","text":"test"}'
```

### Logs

```bash
# View application logs
tail -f logs/combined.log

# View error logs only
tail -f logs/error.log

# View Cloudflare Worker logs
wrangler tail
```
